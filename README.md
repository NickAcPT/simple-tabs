# Filter, colour, customize!
Simple Tabs is a purely client-side mod to organize incoming chat messages using custom filters defined using a literal match or regex. 
Organize your tabs further by storing them in different groups and pages and give them your colours to match!

Fabric re-code of the original mod written by [FloorIsJava](https://gitlab.com/FloorIsJava/SimpleTabs) for forge, feature ideas by Rinjani.
