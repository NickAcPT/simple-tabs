Simple Tabs is a purely client-side mod to organize incoming chat messages using custom filters defined using a literal match or regex.
Organize your tabs further by storing them in different groups and pages and give them your colours to match!

Fabric re-code of the original mod written by [FloorIsJava](https://gitlab.com/FloorIsJava/SimpleTabs) for forge, feature ideas by Rinjani. 

Uses [Java's regex](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) engine and syntax flavour,
**requires [Fabric API]() and [Fabric Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin) present in mods folder**.
